You need to add your two resume PDF files to the `/public` folder:

```bash
# Place these files in the public folder:
/public/Connor_McNeely_ME_Resume.pdf
/public/Connor_McNeely_AI_Dev_Resume.pdf
```

**Note:** The resume buttons are already configured and will work once you add these files.

### 2. **Test the Application**
```bash
# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev
