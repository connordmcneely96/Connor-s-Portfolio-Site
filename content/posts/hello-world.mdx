# Welcome

This is my first blog post. Here I'll share insights from my journey bridging mechanical engineering and AI development.

## What to Expect

- **Engineering Deep Dives**: Technical breakdowns of pump design, rotating equipment, and manufacturing processes
- **AI & ML Projects**: Building RAG systems, multi-agent architectures, and engineering-focused AI tools
- **Full-Stack Development**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, and modern web development practices

Stay tuned for more content!
