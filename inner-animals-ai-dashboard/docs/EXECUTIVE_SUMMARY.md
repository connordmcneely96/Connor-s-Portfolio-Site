# Inner Animals AI Platform
## Executive Summary

---

## The Opportunity

The AI services market is experiencing explosive growth, but there's a critical gap:

**Clay.global and similar platforms** offer simple chatbot integrations ($5K-15K) that are too basic for enterprise needs.

**Custom AI development** costs $100K-500K+ and takes 6-12 months, putting it out of reach for most businesses.

**Inner Animals fills this gap** with a production-ready platform for $25K-150K projects, delivered in 4-8 weeks.
